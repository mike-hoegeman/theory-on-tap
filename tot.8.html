                   Lesson 8, Minor Scales </h1>

  by: <strong> Grant D. Green </strong>
  <p>

  There are three different minor scales:  the natural 
  minor, the harmonic minor, and the melodic minor.  All three 
  are used, and they differ by only a few notes.  All minor 
  scales have the third degree lowered (as least as compared with 
  the corresponding major scale), but differ in their treatment 
  of the sixth and seventh notes.

        <h2>A.      Natural Minor</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The natural minor is identical to the Aeolian mode.  
  Thus, if you play a C major scale, but start on A, you've played 
  the A natural minor scale:

  To find the natural minor key, start with the major scale 
  and lower the third, sixth, and seventh notes.  An easy way to figure 
  out the key signatures is to simply add three flats (or take away 
  three sharps, or some combination) to the major key signature.  
  Thus, if you start with C (no sharps or flats), C minor has three 
  flats.  The key of A major (three sharps) becomes A minor (no 
  sharps), and D major (two sharps) becomes D minor (one flat).  If 
  you have less than three sharps, cancel out the sharps with an equal 
  number of flats, and add any flats that are left over.  Note that 
  three flats is also the key signature for Eb major, and Eb is the 
  minor third of the C minor scale (and triad).  Thus, counting up a 
  minor third from the root will give you the key signature for the 
  minor key of that root.

  Perhaps the easiest way to visualize this is to think of the 
  Circle of Fifths.  If you can find your key on the CoF, you simply 
  count three keys in the "flat" direction to find the key signature 
  for the corresponding minor key.  It works the other way, too.  If 
  you have a known key signature (for example, five flats, Db), you 
  can count *back* three keys (i.e., go 3 in the sharp direction) 
  around the CoF and find the root for the relative minor (Bb minor).

  Because C minor and Eb major have the same key signature, 
  C minor is known as the "relative minor" of Eb major.  Similarly, 
  F# minor is the relative minor of A major, A minor is the relative 
  minor of C major, G minor is the relative minor of Bb major, and so 
  on.  Try it!  What is the relative minor for D major?  What is the 
  minor key that has one sharp in the key signature?  (Answers at the 
  end of the lesson.)

  You can play the natural scale as shown below.  I've put 
  fingerings for both melody and bass together, but you may find it 
  difficult to play both hands in the same area of the fingerboard.  I 
  suggest taking the right hand up an octave (12 frets up, or up 7 
  frets and over a string).  As always on the Stick(R), you can transfer
  the pattern anywhere on the neck, to play a minor scale in any key.

  The only problem with the natural minor scale is that it 
  omits the "leading tone."  In common practice (Baroque and Classical 
  music), the leading tone is one of the most important notes of the 
  scale.  It even has its own abbreviation:  LT.  The LT is always a 
  half step below the root (or octave) of the scale, and almost always 
  resolves to the root.  In fact, it is the LT (as the major third of 
  the dominant V chord) that is responsible for the "dominant" sound 
  of the V chord.  If the seventh tone is lowered (as it is in the 
  natural minor), you end up with a minor dominant V chord - almost 
  a contradiction in terms.  It just doesn't provide the same feeling 
  of resolution (cadence) that a major V chord does.  Try playing:

  playing E major this time.  (The Am-Dm-Am is just to get your ear set 
  in the key of A minor.)  Makes a difference, doesn't it?  As long as 
  the root (I) chord is minor, the whole key will tend to sound minor, 
  whether the V is minor or not.  However, making the V minor destroys 
  some of the resolution feeling of the cadence, so common practice 
  composers weren't entirely satisfied with it.  So, they developed...

        <h2>B.      The Harmonic Minor</h2>

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The harmonic minor scale has the same key signature as the 
  natural minor, but has the seventh note restored to its original 
  (major) position.  Thus, the A harmonic minor scale is:

  This made many composers happy:  it restored the LT, which 
  was important to their melodies, and it restored the major V (not to 
  mention the dom V7), which was important to their harmonies and 
  cadences.  (Perhaps I should mention that an authentic cadence is 
  V-I in common practice, not to be confused with the IV-I "plagal 
  cadence" [think "Amen"] or the V-VI "deceptive cadence."  OK, maybe 
  I *shouldn't* mention it.)

  I should point out here that you can play the harmonic minor 
  scale starting on different notes to get the equivalent of modes, 
  just as in the major scale modes.  Does anyone use them?  Sure.  
  They're good for some of the altered jazz chords.  Do they have 
  their own names (like Dorian)?  I have no idea.

  Notice the stretch from 6 to 7?  The interval is an 
  augmented second.  It is not considered a minor third, even 
  though both have 3 half steps, and are "enharmonically" the same.  
  If you play an augmented second and a minor third in isolation, 
  they'll sound identical (at least, they will on modern instruments, 
  or anything tuned in equal temperment).  The common practice 
  composers considered augmented intervals too dissonant to use (it 
  does sound a little funny, doesn't it?), so they had *another* 
  problem.  The harmonic minor provides all the right scale tones 
  for constructing the triads, but bollixed up the melodies with that 
  odd augmented interval.  So, composers decided to keep the harmonic 
  minor for figuring out chord progressions, but for melodies they 
  would use...

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Since composers were unwilling to lose their LT, and didn't 
  like the augmented leap from 6 to 7, there was only one thing to do:  
  raise the sixth back to where it is in the major scale.  The key 
  signature stays the same:  its just that now the sixth and seventh 
  notes have naturals (or sharps) where they have flats or naturals in 
  the natural minor.  The third is *always* lowered.  (If you raise the 
  third again, you end up with a major I triad, so you're completely 
  back to the major key.)

  This makes the sixth a major sixth.  Unfortunately, this makes 
  the scale lose quite a bit of its minor character.  Try playing it:

  However, since you don't *really* need that leading tone when 
  you're going *down* the scale, there's no real reason to raise the 
  seventh when descending.  And if you don't have to raise the 
  seventh, you don't have an augmented second between the sixth and 
  seventh, and don't have to raise the sixth either.  But if you lower 
  the sixth and the seventh, you're right back to the natural minor.

  The melodic minor scale has two different forms (at least in 
  classical music):  one for going up, and a different one for going down.  
  The ascending melodic minor is the one immediately above, with the 
  raised sixth and seventh.  The descending form is the same as the 
  natural minor at the top.  Jazz sometimes (usually?) uses the ascending 
  form for both directions.  Of course, it can be hard to tell, as one 
  often throws a few extra notes in the scale anyway.  ;-)

  And, of course, you can start the melodic minor scale on any 
  note, and play the corresponding modes.
