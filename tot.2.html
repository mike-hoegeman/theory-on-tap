    <h1 align=center>Theory On Tap<br>Lesson 2: What are Triads?</h1>
    <div align=center>by: <strong>Rick Bellinger</strong><p></div>

    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    This lesson concerns triads, the most rudimentary chord type. Triads are
    simply chords with three separate "voices" (i.e., three separate notes.)
    As with <a href="tot.1.html">intervals</a>, the most important thing is
    to associate the sound with the name.

    <h2>Tertian Harmony</h2>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    <em>Tertian</em> harmony refers to harmonies based in thirds. This means 
    the second tone of the chord will be a third above the root, and the third 
    tone will be a third above the second tone, etc. Tertian triads form the 
    backbone of European harmony, from which jazz harmony evolved. The basic 
    harmonic unit in jazz theory is the seventh chord (often extended to 
    include ninths, elevenths and thirteenths.)


    <h2>Symbols and terms</h2>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    I will use the following symbols and terms in this lesson. I hope the
    meaning will become clear as you read on.


    <ul>
      <li><h3>Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Chord</em> - group of three or more notes played at the same
                               time
          <li><em>Arpeggio</em> - notes of a chord played simultaneously,
                               ascending or descending.
          <li><em>Triad</em> - a chord with only three different notes.<br>
			       <i><small>Classically, it usually means a set
			       of three notes that can be stacked
			       vertically in thirds. In the 20th
			       cenury, it can also mean any combination
			       of three different pitches.
                               </small></i>

          <li><em>Root</em> - starting note from which an interval, scale or
                               chord is founded on. The letter name for the
                               root will be the letter name for a chord or
                               scale built on that root. For example, if a 
                               major triad has a C for the root, it is called 
                               a C major triad. If a minor scale has A for 
                               the root, it is called an A minor scale.
          <li><em>Consonant</em> - stable or pleasant sounding.
          <li><em>Dissonant</em> - unstable or unpleasant sounding.
        </ul>
        <p>
      <li><h3>Symbols</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em>R</em> - root
          <li><em>m(i)</em> - minor
          <li><em>M(a)</em> - major
          <li><em>P</em> - Perfect
          <li><em>di</em> - diminished
          <li><em>au</em> - augmented
          <li><em>sus4</em> - suspended 4th, a type of triad.
        </ul>
    </ul>


    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    Numbers will usually indicate intervals. For example, 3 will mean a third.
    Ma3 will mean a major third.


    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    I am using this notation primarily because it is easy for this
    medium.  However, many notation systems exist, along with many
    arguments about which one is correct. In reality, you should
    know as many as possible, 'cause you never know what you're
    gonna find on your lead sheet! We will learn more when we talk
    about seventh chords. (Note: My jazz harmony teacher preferred
    Ma and mi as opposed to the more standard M and m because he
    had trouble telling student's big M's from their little m's!)


    <h2>Five Common Triads</h2>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    Here are five of the most common triads in Western music. (Very similar
    diagrams can be found lining the back of certain lower pages on the
    <a HREF="http://clever.net/stick/stickwire">Stickwire</a> web page, 
    courtesy of Vance Gloster).


    <h3>The Major Triad</h3>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    You will probably recognize the sound of this one
    instantly. It has a kind of "bright" quality to it. Most songs in a major
    key will "resolve" to this chord- that is, the other chords played will
    make you want to hear this chord after them. Here is how to play it on the
    melody strings


    <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target='popup' href='images/major_triad.svg' >
            <img width=450 src='images/major_triad.svg'></img>
        </a>
      </td>

      <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>

      <td>

          <td>p5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
          <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
          <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
          <td ALIGN=CENTER>^</td>

          <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Between tones:</td>
          <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
          <td>Ma3</td>
          <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
          <td>mi3</td>
          <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>


    <h3>The Minor Triad</h3>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    This is also a very recognizable chord, just a little less common than the
    major triad. It has a "darker" quality to it than the major triad does.
    Here is how to play it on the melody strings:

    <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target='popup' href='images/minor_triad.svg' >
            <img width=450 src='images/minor_triad.svg'></img>
        </a>
      </td>

      <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>

      <td>
        <table>
        <caption align=top> <strong>Interval distances</strong></caption>
        <tr>
           <td>From root:</td>
           <td>R</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>mi3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>p5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td ALIGN=CENTER>^</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td ALIGN=CENTER>^</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td>Between tones:</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>mi3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>Ma3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <p>

    <Strong>Note:</strong> that the only difference between this chord and a 
    major triad is that it has a minor third instead of a major third. 
    <br>
    <Strong>Note:</strong> that these intervals are reversed from the major triad.


    <h3>The Augmented triad</h3>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    This is simply a major triad with an augmented 5th. It is somewhat rare,
    and generally occurs only in music with a "minor" key (however, John
    Coltrane's arrangement of "Summertime" on his "My Favorite Things"
    prominently features augmented chords!) It has a much more "dissonant"
    quality. Here is how it is played on the melody strings:


    <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target='popup' href='images/augmented_triad.svg' >
            <img width=450 src='images/augmented_triad.svg'></img>
        </a>
      </td>

      <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>

      <td>
        <table>
        <caption align=top><strong>Interval distances</strong></caption>
        <tr>
           <td>From root:</td>
           <td>R</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>Ma3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>au5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td ALIGN=CENTER>^</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td ALIGN=CENTER>^</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td>Between tones:</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>Ma3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>Ma3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
      </td>

    </tr>
    </table>


    <h3>The Diminished Triad</h3>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    This is a minor triad with a diminished 5th. It is also dissonant and not
    so commonly used, but it can provide a "pivot" in jazz chord progressions.
    Here is how to play it on the melody strings:

    <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target='popup' href='images/diminished_triad.svg' >
            <img width=450 src='images/diminished_triad.svg'></img>
        </a>
      </td>

      <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>

      <td>
        <table>
        <caption align=top><strong>Interval distances</strong></caption>
        <tr>
           <td>From root:</td>
           <td>R</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
           <td>mi3</td>
           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>

        </tr>

           <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
           <td>Between tones:</td>

        </tr>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>The sus4 chord</h3>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    This chord began to appear in a lot of '70s pop recordings, including
    Steely Dan (which usually gets praise from jazz musicians). It is simply a
    major triad with the major 3rd raised to the perfect 4th. The chord makes
    you want to hear the 4th lowered to the 3rd ("resolved"), and it may be
    followed by a major chord with the same root or may act as a "pivot" to a
    different chord. Here is how it is played on the melody strings:

    <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a target='popup' href='images/sus4_chord.svg' >
            <img width=450 src='images/sus4_chord.svg'></img>
        </a>
      </td>

      <td> <img alt=" " src="./images/dot_clear.gif"> </td>

    <h2>Inversions</h2>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    The <em>voicings</em> (order of tones) of the above examples
    are all <em>root position</em> voicings of the chords. That
    means the root is the lowest tone, followed by the 3rd as the
    next highest, and then the 5th. These tones don't always have
    to be played in that order. If we play the 3rd, then the 5th,
    and then the root, we call the voicing the <em>first inversion</em>.
    If we play the 5th, then the root, then the 3rd, the voicing
    is called the <em>second inversion</em> You should know all the
    inversions for each chord.  Here is how they are played on the
    melody strings:

    <h3>Major triad and inversions</h3>

  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
    (I designed these charts to save space. Note that the tones of the root
    positions chords are all on the lower three melody strings. The tones of
    the 1st inversion are all on the next three strings. The notes of the 2nd
    inversions are all on the highest three melody strings. I will place the
    slash \ as a fret symbol to separate different chords when I think they are
    too confusing).

    <h2>Triads on the bass stings</h2>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    Because the bass strings of the stick are usually tuned in the wider
    perfect 5th interval, it is not easy to play the above triads on the bass
    strings. Two ways around this are a) use both hands, and b) use the "B.C."
    (Bob Culbertson) method, which involves using the thumb of your left hand
    to play notes. However, because of the relationships of the melody strings
    to the bass strings, these aren't really necessary. As we learned in the
    previous lesson, a perfect 4th is the inversion of a perfect 5th, and
    vice-versa. What this means for the stick is that you can move a chord
    pattern from the melody strings to the bass strings, but keep the same note
    as the root.  The chord will have the same <em>quality</em>, but all the notes
    will be inverted! It will sound very similar, but the spacing between the
    actual notes played is greater. (Note: in <em>legit</em> theory, these 
    voicings are called <em>open structure</em> voicings, which means that 
    the lowest and highest tones are more than one octave apart. The all 
    the chords shown above are <em>close structure</em> chords, meaning that 
    the lowest and highest tones fall within one octave.)

    Try playing all the melody string patterns chord patterns on the bass
    strings. Listen for the similarities and differences of the chords. (Note:
    chords generally sound better in higher registers, so try to stick to the
    higher bass stings.)

    <h2>Ear training</h2>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    You should always learn to associate three things in your head: a name, a
    symbol, and a sound. The sound is, of course, what we're after. The name is
    for our convenience - it lets us communicate what we are doing to each
    other. The symbol serves the same purpose, but on paper (or in this case,
    on your computer screen).

    Make sure you can identify all the chords above when you hear them. This
    takes practice. Play them frequently, and maybe record them in random order
    and listen to the tape a week later to see if you can identify them. Again,
    there are some excellent ear training tapes and software available to help
    you.
