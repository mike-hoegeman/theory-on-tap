  Lesson 12: Symmetrical & synthetic scales<br>plus other random junk </h2>
  </h2>
    
<div align=center>by: <b>Will Pirkle and Rick Bellinger</b>, <small><i>Et al.</i></small></div>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  This lesson is on "Symmetrical" scales although we will also touch a little
  on Synthetic scales. The Major Scale and its modes make up the largest
  portion of frequently used note-series and there are also some variations
  (harmonic and melodic minor, and their modes) which get a lot of usage.
  However, there are some "miscellaneous" scales which although less common,
  can be quite useful. These include the so-called "Symmetrical" scales named
  as such because they are set up using repeated series of intervals. The
  easiest one is the Chromatic Scale.

  <p>
  <h2>Symmetrical Scales</h2>
  <p>
  <h3>A. The Chromatic Scale</h3>

  <p>
  The Chromatic scale is a set of continued half-steps. The formula is
  <p>
  <center><pre> H H H H H H H H H H H H </pre></center>


  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  In theory, there is only one chromatic scale (C); all other chromatic
  scales could be considered to be modes of the first.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The name is taken from the Greek <i>Chromos</i> meaning "color" -- many
  musicians think of chromaticism as adding color to their playing. My
  favorite way to use chromaticism is to "fill in" the pentatonic pattern
  with half-steps:

  <p>

  <table><tr>

  <td><a target='popup' 
  href='images/Melody_side_minor_pentatonic_blues_scale.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_side_minor_pentatonic_blues_scale.svg'>
  </img></a></td>

  <td><a target='popup' 
  href='images/Melody_side_chromaticised_minor_pentatonic_blues_scale.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_side_chromaticised_minor_pentatonic_blues_scale.svg'>
  </img></a></td>

  </tr></table>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Now, this is an exaggerated example, but you get the picture. Look at all
  the half-steps. You can chromaticise any scale or scale fragment this way.
  A Pure chromatic scale looks like this:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_side_pure_chromatic_scale.svg'>
  <img width=65% src='images/Melody_side_pure_chromatic_scale.svg'></img></a>

  <br>
  Another way is to slide the first two notes on each string which puts the whole thing in one (big) position:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_side_1_position_chromatic_scale.svg'>
  <img width=50% src='images/Melody_side_1_position_chromatic_scale.svg'></img></a>

  <p>

  <p>
  <h3>B. The WholeTone Scale</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The WholeTone Scale consists of successive whole-steps (1 whole step = 2
  Frets). The sound is "dreamy" -- in TV shows and movies, when a person is
  daydreaming or having a (memory) flashback, or in a state of wonder or
  amazement, you will almost always hear the WholeTone Scale in the
  soundtrack. In the introduction to Stevie Wonder's "You Are the Sunshine of
  My Life," where Stevie plays an ascending WholeTone scale harmonized in
  major thirds.

  <blockquote>
  In theory, there are only 2 WholeTone Scales (C and C&sharp;), with all others
  being modes of these two.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The WholeTone Scale has 6 notes instead of the usual 7:<br>

  <center><pre>W W W W W W</pre></center>

  <p>
  The WholeTone scales plays out like this:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_side_whole_tone_scale_pattern_1.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_side_whole_tone_scale_pattern_1.svg'></img></a>

  <p>
  or this:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_side_whole_tone_scale_pattern_2.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_side_whole_tone_scale_pattern_2.svg'></img></a>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  To me, they are both unruly. WholeTone Scales are usually used sparingly
  -- for short segments. A good example is the Django Reinhardt's <a href='https://youtu.be/cABQ1-V_1bY?si=POJjYWndXXYVyeF0'>Improvisation 1</a> (<i>played by Stephane Wrembel here</i>). Particularly in the starting section of the song.
  This song also uses a lot of chromaticism so it's a good video to study to see how you can emply these two nebulous scales to make interesting transitions.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Neither the Chromatic nor WholeTone Scale produces a good sense of
  key-center. Play long sequences (ascending/decending/mixed) over one bass
  note and this will be clear. It produces a nice effect, in that you can
  temporarily suspend the key of your piece.

  <h3>C. The Diminished Scale</h3>

  <p>
  The Diminished Scale is a repeating series of alternating whole and 
  half steps:<br>

  <p>
  <pre><center> H W H W H W H W  <i>aka Half/Whole</i></center></pre>
  or<p>
  <pre><center> W H W H W H W H  <i>aka Whole/Half</i></center></pre>

  <blockquote>
  In theory, there are only 3 Diminished Scales (C C&sharp; D) with all others
  being modes of these 3.<br>
  <br>
  And, notice that this scale has 8 notes instead of the usual 7. The "extra"
  note comes from the fact that both the 3 and &flat;3 are in it.
  </blockquote>

<p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Whereas Chromatic and WholeTone scales are kind of simple in construction,
  the Diminished Scale has a slight complexity to it.


<p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The first complexity is that there are 2 ways to view the pattern:
  Whole-Half and Half-Whole depending on how you start the sequence -- see
  patterns above. Also note that the patterns contain each other: there is a
  W H W pattern inside of H W H W H. In other words, they are the same scale,
  but starting from an adjacent note.

<p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The second complexity is that the Diminished Scale contains all sorts of
  combinations of intervals. The Half-Whole scale gives you a choice of
  intervals for the third, fifth, and seventh tones of a chord. The third can
  be either major or minor. The fifth can be either perfect or diminished.
  The seventh can be either minor (which is also dominant) or diminished.
  Thus you can obtain the following triads; major, minor or diminished. You
  can also derive any of the following seventh chords; Dominant 7, Minor 7,
  Minor 7 (&flat;5), or Diminished 7. Conversely, the half-whole diminished scale
  can be played over any of these chords!

<p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The third complexity is that part about there being only 3 diminished
  scales. The C-diminished scale contains the same notes as the E&flat;, G&flat;, and A
  -diminished scales.

<p>
  So, C-E&flat;-G&flat;-A spells:
  <ul>
    <li> the C dim7 chord
    <li> the E&flat; dim7 chord (E&flat;-G&flat;-A-C)
    <li> the G&flat; dim7 chord (G&flat;-A-C-E&flat;)
    <li> the A dim7 chord (A-C-E&flat;-G&flat;)
  </ul>

<p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  (Note: You might want to revisit section C of <a href=tot.9.html>
  Lesson 9</a> by Grant Green for more information on diminished chords.)

<p>
  Lets look at a few examples of diminished scale usage and discuss some of
  its other "features."

  <p>
  The Whole-Half and Half/Whole patterns for the Dim Scale looks like this:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_dim_scale_H_W_H_W_pattern.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_dim_scale_H_W_H_W_pattern.svg'></img></a>

  <p>
  To play a Half/Whole, start anywhere, on a "H"<br>
  To play a Whole/Half, start anywhere, on a "W"

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Notice that if you use four notes to a string, the pattern will "creep" to
  the right. If you use three notes to a string, the pattern will creep to
  the left, like this;

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_dim_scale_3_note_per_string_pattern.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_dim_scale_3_note_per_string_pattern.svg'></img></a>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Check out the two strips of interval patterns of minor2-P4 construction.
  Or, you can do this:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' 
  href='./images/Melody_dim_scale_4_3_3_pattern.svg'>
  <img src='images/Melody_dim_scale_4_3_3_pattern.svg'></img></a>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Notice that this is a pattern that repeats after every three strings; it's
  basically the '3 notes per string' pattern, but with an extra note thrown
  onto the third string of the pattern to keep it from creeping too far to
  the left!  A little more compact in position, but complex in pattern.

  <h6>Good Rule of Thumb:</h6>
  <ul>
  <li>Whole-Half --- for playing over diminished chords
  <li>Half Whole --- for playing over altered dominant chords [1]
  </ul>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  Example: Play the vii dim7 over the V7 chord:<br>
  <p>

  Key of C: vii dim7 = B dim7 = B D F A&flat;<br>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8><b>and</b><br>
  the V7 of C is G7 = G B D F<br>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8><b>then</b><br>
  the B dim7 has many common notes (B D F), and contains a funky &flat;2 (&flat;9) the
  A&flat;, as well. Play the B dim7 over the G7 (or G7&flat;9).

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  How about the B half-whole scale? It contains: <br>

    B C D D&sharp; F F&sharp; G&sharp; A

  Play the G half/whole over G7 and get the following cool notes:

     <li> " &flat;9 &sharp;9 " &sharp;11" 13  "  (some heavy alterations to G7, but cool sounding if done right)<br>

    In classical music, the dim7 is used as a Dominant Preparation (just before
    the closing V7-I cadence, a big diminished chord/scale/arpeggio  segment is
    inserted for added buildup).<br>
    <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
    The Allman Brothers, Dead, and Phish use the dim7 this way as well.

<h3>D. The Augmented Scale</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The Augmented Scale a set of alternating Augmented 2nds and minor 2nds (an
  augmented 2nd is the same as a &flat;3). Its formula is:<br>

  <p>
  1 &flat;3 3 5 &sharp;5 7 (it is a 6-note scale)<br>
  1 to &flat;3 = aug2<br>
  &flat;3 to 3 = m2<br>
  3 to  5 = aug2<br>
  5 to &sharp;5 = m2<br>
  &sharp;5 to 7 = aug2<br>

  <p>
  The pattern is:

  <pre>
  |-O--|----|----|-O--|----|----|----|----
  |----|-R--|----|----|-O--|----|----|----
  |----|----|-O--|----|----|-O--|----|----
  |----|----|----|-O--|----|----|-O--|----
  |----|----|----|----|-R--|----|----|-O--
  </pre>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  This pattern involves puting the aug2 interval on the same string, and the
  dim2 between strings. If you reverses it, it becomes:

  <pre>
  |-O--|-O--|----|----|----|----|
  |----|-O--|-R--|----|----|----|
  |----|----|-O--|-O--|----|----|
  |----|----|----|-O--|-O--|----|
  |----|----|----|----|-O--|-R--|
  </pre>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Which is easy to finger, but still creeps to the left. To make it stay in
  one place, add these notes:

  <pre>
  |----|-O--|----|----|-O--|-O--|
  |----|-O--|-R--|----|----|-O--|
  |----|----|-O--|-O--|----|----|
  |----|----|----|-O--|-O--|----|
  |----|-O--|----|----|-O--|-R--|
  </pre>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The pattern on the last string is identical to the pattern on the first
  string; thus the whole pattern will repeat from there (if you had an
  infinitely wide fret board). It's the above pattern, but with extra notes
  added onto the first, forth and fifth strings of the pattern to keep it
  from wandering left again. However, take care that the root will be in a
  different place in the rest of the pattern!

  <h2>Synthetic Scales</h2>

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The last thing I want to discuss (briefly...) is Synthetic scales. Of all
  the possible 7-note scales, we only use a handful of them. And, all but a
  few are combinations of W and H steps = Major2 (M2) and minor 2 (m2)
  intervals. But, theoretically, you can have any combination, so long as it
  is 7 notes. Like this horror:

  <p>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Basically anything OTHER than the scales we already use. A good way is to
  start with a common scale, then just change one note.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Another way is to splice "tetrachords" together. What's a tetrachord? It's
  simply a string of four sequential notes, usually comprising half of a
  scale. A major tetrachord is the first four notes of a major scale. A minor
  tetrachord is the first four notes of a minor scale. A major scale is
  simply a minor tetrachord stacked on top of a major tetrachord! Also, a
  melodic minor tetrachord is a major tetrachord spliced to the end of a
  minor tetrachord. (Note that in the above examples, the last note of the
  second tetrachord will be the same as the first note of the second
  tetrachord. Thus you have eight notes, but only seven distinct pitches. If
  you splice two minor tetrachords together, you get a diminished scale, with
  eight notes and eight distinct pitches).
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  You can splice some tetrachords together in unusual combinations to arrive
  at some interesting synthetic scales. If you stack the second half of a
  harmonic minor scale on top of a major tetrachord, you get something called
  a "Harmonic Major" Scale, which can also be looked at as either a harmonic
  minor scale with a raised third or a major scale with a flat sixth. You can
  also get some fairly exotic scales like the "Double Harmonic" scale, which
  is comprised of two identical tetrachords from the second half of the
  harmonic minor scale. (Another popular synthetic scale, the "Hungarian
  Minor" Scale, is actually the fourth mode of the double harmonic scale.)

  However you arrive at your 7 notes of choice, fine. Let's pick the
  following at random:

  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>

  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  When you have the notes you want/like/stumble upon, then harmonize the
  whole thing up by stacking every other note (just like has been done in
  several of these lessons). We are mimicking the way Western harmony works.
