  The purpose of this lesson is to show how different chords are derived from
  the major scale. These chords will obviously be the ones most commonly used
  for songs in a major key.

  <h2>Tertian Harmony Revisited</h2>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  As we learned in <a href="tot.2.html">Lesson 2</a>, Western harmony is 
  based on thirds. We can derive triads from scales by choosing every other
  note of a mode until we have three notes from that mode. Starting with a
  C major scale, we start with the C as the root, and skip a third up the
  scale to get E as the second note. We skip another third above E to get
  G, which is a fifth above the C. The notes C,E and G make up a major triad.

  <p>
  Here are the triads derived from modes of a C major scale:

  <p>
  <table>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <th>Mode</th>  <th>Notes</th>  <th>Type of triad</th>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Ionian (major)</td>   
    <td>C, E, G</td>            
    <td>Major Triad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Dorian</td>           
    <td>D, F, A</td>            
    <td>Minor Triad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Phrygian</td>         
    <td>E, G, B</td>            
    <td>Minor Triad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Lydian</td>           
    <td>F, A, C</td>            
    <td>Major Triad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Mixolydian</td>       
    <td>G, B, D</td>            
    <td>Major Triad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Aeolian</td>          
    <td>A, C, E</td>            
    <td>Minor Triad</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=left>
    <td>Locrian</td>          
    <td>B, D, F</td>            
    <td>Diminished Triad</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  All major scales will contain seven different triads, which include three
  major triads (built on the first, fourth, and fifth notes of the scale),
  three minor triads (built on the second, third and sixth notes of the
  scale), and one diminished triad (built on the seventh note of the scale).
  (As we shall see in a later lesson, an augmented triad is derived from the
  harmonic and melodic minor scales.)

  <p>
  <i>Try playing the above triads from the C major scale. Refer to the chord
  voicings given in lesson 2.

  <h2>Seventh Chords derived from the major scale</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  If we extend our chords one more third, we get the seventh tone of the
  scale. The result is called a seventh chord. For example, if we start with
  a C major triad derived from a C major scale, and go one more third above
  the fifth (G), we get a B for the seventh.

  <p>
  Here are the seventh chords derived from a C major scale:

  A major scale will contain the following types of Seventh chords: Two Major
  7 chords (from the 1st and 4th tones), three minor 7 chords (from the 2nd,
  3rd and 6th tones), one dominant 7 chord (from the 5th), and one
  half-diminished chord (from the 7th).

  <h2>Structure of seventh chords</h2>
  <p>
  <big>A C <b>major 7 chord</b></big> is a C major triad with a B added as the
  7th. Note that B is a major seventh above the root C. The notes
  in a major 7 chord will always have the following intervals above
  the (<tt>R</tt>)oot:

  <p>
  <tt>R, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Major 7th.</tt>

  <p>
  <big>A <b>dominant 7 chord</b></big> is exactly like a major
  chord, except that it has a minor 7th. The notes of a dominant 7
  chord will always have the following intervals above root: <p>

  <tt>R, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th, Major 7th.</tt>

  <p>
  This chord has an interval of a tritone between its 3rd and 7th tones,
  which give it a more dissonant sound. A standard blues progression is made
  up of dominant 7 chords (more on this in a later lesson.) Note that the
  word dominant is usually dropped when naming this chord (i.e. a G dominant
  7 chord is usually just called a G7 chord.

  <p>
  <big>A <b>minor 7 chord</b></big> is a minor triad with a minor seventh. The intervals in
  a minor 7 chord are: 
  <p>
  <tt>R, Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th, Minor 7th.</tt>

  <p>
  <big>A <b>half-diminished chord, or minor 7 b5</b></big>, is
  exactly like a minor, but with a diminished 5th (or b5). The
  intervals are: R, Minor 3rd, Diminished 5, Minor 7th. A diminished
  chord (derived from the harmonic minor scale, as we shall see
  later) is exactly like the half-diminished chord, except that it
  has a diminished 7th instead of the minor seventh. Thus a
  half-diminished chord is a mix between a diminished chord and a
  minor chord, hence its name. This chord is rarely used in major
  keys; it occurs much more often in minor chord progressions,
  particularly a minor II-V-I progression (more on this in a
  subsequent lesson).

  <p>
  The following shows the intervals that make up the chord types (see
  <a href="tot.2.html">Lesson 2</a> for meaning of symbols):

  <p>
  <strong>C Major 7 chord</strong>
  <pre>
    notes:      C    E    G     B

                  ^     ^    ^
    intervals:   Ma3   mi3  Ma3
  </pre>

  <strong>G dominant 7 chord</strong>
  <pre>
    notes:      G    B    D     F
    scale tone: R   Ma3   P5   mi7
                  ^     ^    ^
    intervals:   Ma3   mi3  mi3
  </pre>

  <strong>A Minor 7 chord</strong>

  <h2>Chord Symbols</h2>
  <p>
  There are many systems of chord symbols used by different players.
  <br>
  <a target='popup' href='chord_chart.html' > &rarr; Here is a chart &larr; </a>
  you can refer to with most of the various chord symbols in use.

  <p>
  <strong>Major 7 chords:</strong>
  I will use <em>C Ma7</em> for a <em>C major 7</em> chord.<br>
  <em>C Maj 7</em> and <em>C Mi7</em> are also common. Sometimes a triangle 
  is used between the letter name and the 7.

  <p>
  <strong>Dominant 7 chords:</strong>
  I will use <em>G7</em> for a <em>G dominant 7</em> chord. 
  Some people use <em>G dom7</em>, but <em>G7</em> is by far the most common.

  <p>
  <strong>Minor 7 chords:</strong>
  I will use <em>A mi7</em> for an <em>A minor 7</em> chord. 
  <em>A-7</em>, <em>A min7</em> and <em>A mi7</em> are also common.

  <p>
  <strong>Half-diminished chords:</strong>
  I will use <em>B min7(b5)</em> for a <em>B half 
  diminished chord</em>. A common symbol is a B followed by a circle with 
  a slash (/) through it. A circle o is often used for diminished 
  chords; thus a circle with a line through it means "half diminished".

  <h2>Seventh chords on the melody strings</h2>

  <p>
  Here are seventh chord voicings for the melody strings. These are all
  voiced with just R-3-5-7. These are all for standard tuning. Make sure you
  use a fixed-space font such as Courier to view these diagrams. Vertical
  lines indicate frets, while horizontal lines indicate strings.

  <h2>Seventh chord voicings on both bass and melody strings</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Some of the above voicings can be a difficult stretch. However, it is
  common to put the root on a bass instrument. Look at the above chords, and
  cover up the root with your hand. Notice that the three top notes are all
  shapes of triads that we learned in lesson 2! If we play the root on the
  bass strings, we can voice these chords as a triad one third above the bass
  note.

  Here are formulas for voicing seventh chords as triads over bass notes:

  <p>
  <strong>Major 7:</strong>
   Play a minor triad who's root is a major third above the seventh
  chord's root.

  <p>
  <td width=480>
  <strong>Minor 7:</strong>
  Play a major triad who's root is a minor third above the seventh
  chord's root.

  <p>
  <strong>Dominant 7:</strong>
  Play a diminished triad who's root is a major third above the
  seventh chord's root.

  <p>
  <strong>Minor 7 b5:</strong>
  Play a minor triad who's root is a minor third above the
  seventh chord's root.

  <p>
  Although the root should be in the bass, you do not necessarily have to
  play the other chord tones in order. You can have the 3rd or 5th as the
  highest tone. Therefore, you can use any inversion of the triad to make up
  the chord voicing.

  <blockquote>
  <strong>Exercise 4:</strong>
  Name the triad you would use starting from the third tone to
  play the following chords as seventh chords over bass notes: C Ma7, F Ma7,
  G7, D7, A mi7, D mi7, B mi7(b5), E mi7(b5). Then play each of the chords on
  your Stick(TM)!
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Seventh chord voicings on the bass strings</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  You will often want to accompany yourself by playing chords on the bass
  strings while you play the melody or solo on the melody strings. The
  following are chord voicings for the bass strings. Note that you can often
  omit the 5th of the chord, unless it is an altered (# or b) 5th (as in the
  minor 7 b5 chord.) Therefore, most of the following chords omit the 5th.

  I attempted to show three voicings for each chord; one with the root on the
  lowest string, one with the root on the second lowest (7th) string, and one
  with the root on the third lowest (8th) string. For the minor 7 b5 chord, I
  couldn't show a chord with the root on the 8th string because it would only
  leave us two higher strings for the remaining 3 notes (remember we
  shouldn't omit the 5th for this chord. Actually, if the melody implies a
  b5, we can sometimes get away with omitting the 5th and using the minor 7th
  chord voicings instead. Just be sure not to use a perfect 5th in the chord,
  melody or solo!)

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  You'll note that some of the chords above are a bit of a handful when
  played on the lower frets. If you have small hands, you may wish to use Bob
  Culbertson's technique of using your left hand thumb to play the root of
  some of the above chords. Give it a try!

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  When playing chords for a song, you should try to pick voicings that
  minimize your hand movement, and allow the bass to progress somewhat
  melodically. Having three possible ways of playing each chord will usually
  allow you to keep the sequence of chords around the same fret.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The best way to learn to play these chords is to go and learn a song that
  uses these voicings. I recommend picking out a song or two from a fake book
  and learning them with both left hand chords and with two hand chords.

  <h2>Extended voicings- 9th, 11th and 13th chords</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We don't have to stop with the seventh in constructing chords. If we keep
  using thirds from the modes, we can add the ninth, 11th and 13th scale
  tones for more "colorful" chord voicings. Again, use the mode the chord is
  derived from in order to find these tones. If we start with the C ionian
  mode, we get:

  <table>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>

    <td><br></td> <td>Ma3</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  However, realize that the 11th tone (F) is a half step away from the Ma3
  (E)! This would give the chord a very dissonant sound, when major chords
  are usually the most consonant. Therefore, we should either omit the 11th,
  or use a #11. The #11 comes from the lydian mode, and will give the chord a
  lydian tonality. If you play a major chord with a #11, make sure the
  soloist knows to play lydian!

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We can think of the seventh chords as fathering chord "families" that can
  all be extended with 9th, 11th, and 13th tones. Of course, chords using all
  these tones will tend to sound very cluttered, so unless that's the effect
  you specifically want, the chord will sound better if you only add one or
  two extra color tones. The 9th and 13th are probably more common for major
  and dominant chords, while the 9th and 11th are perhaps more common for
  minor chords. (Note: a dominant 7th chord takes a #11 for the same reason
  that a major 7th chord does.)

  Here is how to construct major, minor and dominant 13 chords:

  If you look at the intervals between the color tones (9,11 and 13), you'll
  realize these three notes all make up triads. For the major and dominant
  chords, the color tones make up major triads. For the minor chord, the
  color tones make up a minor triad. Thus, a good way to play the above
  chords would be to play the seventh chord on the bass strings, while
  playing a triad whose root is a whole step up on the melody strings. For
  example, here is how you can play the following chords:

  <br>
  <strong>F Ma13 </strong>:
   C Ma7 on bass strings, D Ma triad on melody strings.<br>
  <strong>G 13 </strong>:
  G7 chord on bass strings, A Ma triad on melody strings.<br>
  <strong>Ami13 </strong>:
  Ami7 chord on bass strings, B mi triad on melody strings.<br>

  I've never really seen anyone using extensions for the minor 7 b5 chord,
  but try playing a minor 7 b5 in the left hand and a major triad starting a
  half step higher (on the b9) in the right hand.

  <p>
  That's all for now. Have fun with these chords, and be careful out there!
