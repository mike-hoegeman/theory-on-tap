  In the last lesson we looked at the various minor scales. 
  Now, let's pull out the box of flats and head for the triads and seventh
  chords.
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Each of the minor scales has some triads in common, and some 
  triads peculiar to the specific scale.  We'll look at them one by one.

  <p>
  <h2>I. The Natural Minor Chords </h2>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  You'll recall from the previous lesson that the natural minor 
  scale is like the major scale, but with the 3rd, 6th, and 7th lowered.  
  In the key of A minor, the scale is
  <p>

  <pre>
  A   B   C   D   E   F   G   A
   \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
    w   h   w   w   h   w   w
  <i>where w= whole step and h= half step</i>
  </pre>

  <p>
  <h3>Natural Minor Triads</h3>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The root triad (i) in minor is composed of a root, a minor third, and a 
  perfect fifth.  You can also view it as a major third on top of a minor 
  third (remember that the major triad is a minor third on top of a major 
  third).

  <p>
  For example, in F minor (four flats):
  <pre>
  F    A&flat;    C
   \  /  \  /
  m3    M3    (m3= minor third, M3= major third)
  </pre>

  <p>
  The root triad is <i>always</i> a minor triad in a minor
  key:  you could say that this is what <i>defines</i> the key as minor.
  <p>
  Each of the minor key scales provides a minor root triad, because
  all of the minor key scales have a lowered (minor) third.

  <p>
  In the key of A minor <small>(C major's relative minor to keep it simple)</small>, the triads are as follows:

<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i:</th>
    <td>A, C, E</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii:</th>
    <td>B, D, F</td>
    <td>(diminished, aka dim or o)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III:</th>
    <td>C, E, G</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>iv:</th>
    <td>D, F, A</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>v:</th>
    <td>E, G, B</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VI:</th>
    <td>F, A, C</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii:</th>
    <td>G, B, D</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  Notice that some of the triads are indicated with lower case characters:  
  it is traditional to indicate minor (and diminished) triads in lower case, 
  and major in upper case.  More importantly, notice that the v chord (the 
  dominant V) is now minor.  As was pointed out in <a href="tot.8.html">lesson
  8</a>, having a minor chord for the dominant just doesn't 
  work as well.  This is why you're not very likely to see a "pure" natural 
  minor harmonic progression.

  <p>
  Now, let's play a few, just to see what they sound like.
  The abbreviations in the triad shape diagrams below are: 

<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th >R</th>
    <td>root</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >m3</th>
    <td>minor third, 3 half steps up</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >M3</th>
    <td>major third, 2 whole steps up</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >d5</th>
    <td>diminished fifth, half step below perfect fifth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >P5</th>
    <td>perfect fifth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >a5</th>
    <td>augmented fifth, half step above perfect fifth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >m7</th>
    <td>minor seventh, whole step below root</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th >M7</th>
    <td>major seventh, half step below root</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  <h3>Natural Minor Seventh Chords</h3>
  <p>
  If we look at the seventh chords:

<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i</th>
    <td>A, C, E G</td>
    <td>(minor 7, or min7, or -7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii</th>
    <td>B, D, F, A</td>
    <td>(half diminished 7, or min7&flat;5)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III</th>
    <td>C, E, G, B</td>
    <td>(major 7, or Maj7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>iv</th>
    <td>D, F, A, C</td>
    <td>(minor 7, or -7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>v</th>
    <td>E, G, B, D</td>
    <td>(minor 7, or -7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VI</th>
    <td>F, A, C, E</td>
    <td>(major 7, or Maj7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VII</th>
    <td>G, B, D, F</td>
    <td>(dominant 7, or 7)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  we see that the v is still a minor 7 chord.  There <i>is</i> a
  dominant 7 (the VII7), but this is really the V7 of C, and would
  not resolve correctly to A minor.

  <p>
  OK, so what do they sound like?

  <blockquote>
  <i>
  Note: You are usually not going to attempt to play the seventh chords
  as 4 note block chords on either side of the fretboard. You will usually
  leave out at least 1 note on both sides.
  </i>

  <p>
  <h2>II. The Harmonic Minor Chords</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The harmonic minor differs from the natural minor in that the 
  seventh note is raised, restoring the leading tone found in major keys:

  <p>
  <pre>
  A   B   C   D   E   F   G&sharp;  A
   \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
    w   h   w   w   h   w+  h
  <i>where w+ is an augmented second</i>
  </pre>

  <p>
  <h3>Harmonic Minor Triads</h3>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Since the harmonic minor has the raised seventh, all of the
  triads that contain the seventh get altered (compared with
  the natural minor triads).  The triads affected are the <tt>III, V,</tt> and <tt>VII</tt>
  triads.

  <p>
  Again, in the key of A minor, the harmonic minor triads are as follows:

<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i</th>
    <td>A, C, E</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii</th>
    <td>B, D, F</td>
    <td>(diminished, aka dim or o)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III</th>
    <td>C, E, G&sharp;</td>
    <td>(augmented, aka aug or +)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>iv</th>
    <td>D, F, A</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>V</th>
    <td>E, G&sharp;, B</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VI</th>
    <td>F, A, C</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii</th>
    <td>G&sharp;, B, D</td>
    <td>(diminished)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Notice that the V triad is now major.  It's that raised G&sharp; that makes 
  the V triad major when it would otherwise be minor in the natural minor.  
  This preserves the strong cadence that results in a V-I progression 
  (or V-i in minor keys)
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  In classical voice leading (which we may revisit 
  later on), the third of V (which is the leading tone) always resolves 
  to the root of I (or i).  The III chord has been stretched (augmented), 
  by increasing the interval between its root and fifth (the 3 and 7 of the
  scale).  In contrast, the vii chord is now compressed (diminished), by
  decreasing the interval between its root and fifth (the 7 and 4 of the 
  scale).

  <p>
  <pre>
  C   E   G&sharp;      G&sharp;  B   D
   \ / \ /         \ / \ / 
   M3   M3         m3   m3 
  </pre>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The aug chord is built on a stack of two major thirds, while the dim
  chord is a stack of two minor thirds.  Now, between major, minor, 
  augmented, and diminished triads, we have every possible combination 
  of major and minor thirds (taken in pairs).

  <p>
  The augmented triad is the only new chord here, so let's hear how it
  sounds:

   <p>
   <b>Augmented (iii in harmonic minor)</b>
   <div style="margin-left:5%">
   <a target='popup' href='images/Harmonic_minor_iii_chord.svg' >
      <img width=50% src='images/Harmonic_minor_iii_chord.svg'></img>
   </a>
   </div>

  <p>
  <h3>Harmonic Minor Seventh Chords</h3>
  If we look at the seventh chords:

<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i:</th>
    <td>A, C, E, G&sharp;</td>
    <td>(minor-Maj7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii:</th>
    <td>B, D, F, A</td>
    <td>(half diminished 7, or min7&flat;5)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III:</th>
    <td>C, E, G&sharp;, B</td>
    <td>(augmented 7, or aug7, or +7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>iv:</th>
    <td>D, F, A, C</td>
    <td>(minor 7, or -7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>V:</th>
    <td>E, G&sharp;, B, D</td>
    <td>(dominant 7, or 7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VI:</th>
    <td>F, A, C, E</td>
    <td>(major 7, or Maj7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii:</th>
    <td>G&sharp;, B, D, F</td>
    <td>(diminished 7, or dim7, or o7)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  we see that the dominant seventh (V7) chord is preserved unchanged as well.  
  The V7 resolves to I (or i) with the leading tone (G&sharp; resolving to A, and 
  the seventh (D) resolving to the third of i, or C.  When you take it apart, 
  you can hear the seventh of V7 as a suspension that naturally resolves to 
  the third of the root triad (its even easier to hear with the major progressions).  The third and the seventh provide nearly all the energy and motion 
  contained in the V7 chord:  that's why you can omit the fifth of a dominant 
  seventh chord without changing the character of the chord.  Note:  DON'T 
  leave out the fifth in a diminished or augmented chord.  That's where ALL 
  of the character for those chords comes from.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We've now added the minor-Maj7, the full diminished 7 (dim7) and an 
  augmented 7 (+7), so let's have a listen:

  <p>
  <h2>III. The Melodic Minor</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Just to review, the melodic minor scale has a raised sixth and 
  seventh when ascending, and is the same as the natural minor when 
  descending.

  <p>
  <pre>
  A   B   C   D   E   F&sharp;   G&sharp;  A   G   F   E   D   C   B   A
   \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /  \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
    w   h   w   w   w    w   h   w   w   h   w   w   h   w
   |----ascending-------------&gt|----------descending-------&gt
  </pre>

  <p>
  <h3>Melodic Minor Triads</h3>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We essentially covered the descending melodic minor at the same 
  time we covered the natural minor, so we'll concentrate on the ascending
  form here.  The triads affect by raising the sixth scale note are the II, 
  IV, and VI:

<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i:</th>
    <td>A, C, E</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii:</th>
    <td>B, D, F&sharp;</td>
    <td>(minor)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III:</th>
    <td>C, E, G&sharp;</td>
    <td>(augmented, aug or +)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>IV:</th>
    <td>D, F&sharp;, A</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>V:</th>
    <td>E, G&sharp;, B</td>
    <td>(major)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vi:</th>
    <td>F&sharp;, A, C</td>
    <td>(diminished)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii:</th>
    <td>G&sharp;, B, D</td>
    <td>(diminished)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  We haven't changed the most important chords, V and I, but we've converted
  II from diminished to minor, IV from minor to major, and VI from major to
  diminished.  No new types of chord, just minors and majors in different
  places.

  <p>
  <h3>Melodic Minor Seventh Chords</h3>
  If we look at the seventh chords:

<p>
<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i:</th>
    <td>A, C, E, G&sharp;</td>
    <td>(minor-Maj7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii:</th>
    <td>B, D, F&sharp;, A</td>
    <td>(minor 7, min7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III:</th>
    <td>C, E, G&sharp;, B</td>
    <td>(augmented 7, aug7, or +7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>IV:</th>
    <td>D, F&sharp;, A, C</td>
    <td>(dominant 7, 7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>V:</th>
    <td>E, G&sharp;, B, D</td>
    <td>(dominant 7, 7)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vi:</th>
    <td>F&sharp;, A, C, E</td>
    <td>(half diminished 7, min7&flat;5)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii:</th>
    <td>G&sharp;, B, D, F</td>
    <td>(diminished 7, dim7, or o7)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

  <p>
  we see that we've picked up a second dominant 7 chord (the IV), and a half-
  diminished for VI.  We've already covered these chords as well.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  I should point out here that having a major IV chord makes it harder to 
  firmly establish the tonality in the minor key.  When you hear a chord by 
  itself, you don't know if it is the minor I in a minor key, or something
  like the minor VI in a major key.  For example, the A minor chord could 
  be I in A minor, or VI in C major, or the IV in D minor.  What tips your
  ear off to the key is hearing the chord in relation to other chords of the
  key in a progression, *especially* in a cadence.  I-IV-I and V-I type 
  progressions are among the most useful for really rooting (excuse the pun)
  the key.  An Am-D progression sounds like a II-V progression in G major 
  more than it sounds like A minor.  

  <p>
  <h2>IV. All Together Now</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  So, which set of chords should you use?  The way it typically 
  works is that one uses a combination of chords from all three scales.  I 
  think the most common for "common practice" (classical-type music) are as 
  follows:

<p>
<div style="margin-left:5%"><p><table>
  <tr>
    <th>i:</th>
    <td>A, C, E</td>
    <td>(minor) (N/H/M)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ii:</th>
    <td>B, D, F&sharp;</td>
    <td>(minor) (M)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>III:</th>
    <td>C, E, G</td>
    <td>(major) (N/H)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>iv:</th>
    <td>D, F, A</td>
    <td>(minor) (N/H)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>V:</th>
    <td>E, G&sharp;, B</td>
    <td>(major) (H/M)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VI:</th>
    <td>F, A, C</td>
    <td>(major) (N/H)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii:</th>
    <td>G&sharp;, B, D</td>
    <td>(dim)   (H/M)</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<table border=0 width=500>
<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=40 valign=top>where:</td>
  <td width=440>
  N = natural minor<br>
  H = harmonic minor<br>
  M = ascending melodic minor<br>
  <p>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<table border=0 width=500>
<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The augmented and diminished triads aren't used all that often, at
  least in common practice.  For seventh chords, the likely candidates are:
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>i:</th>
    <td>A, C, E, G</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vii:</th>
    <td>G&sharp;, B, D, F</td>
   <td>(dim7)</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The "preferred" chords for jazz and rock probably vary a bit from
  the "common practice" set, but I'll leave that for (someone else's) later
  lesson on chord progressions.

  <p>
  <h2>The Diminished Seventh Chord</h2>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The diminished 7 (dim7) chord is worth special attention.  First, let's 
  take a closer look at its structure:

  <p>
  <pre>
  G&sharp;    B    D    F
   \   / \  / \  /
    m3    m3   m3
  </pre>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Yes, the dim7 is a stack of minor thirds.  What's more, if you put another 
  minor third on top (A&flat;), you simply start over (G&sharp;/A&flat;).  Since it is all 
  minor thirds, the chord is completely symmetric:  it sounds the same in all 
  inversions.

  The dim7 doesn't truly have a root:  or one can say that it has *four* 
  roots.  If you invert G&sharp; dim7, you get B-D-F-G&sharp;/A&flat;), which you can see it 
  is the vii7 (dim7) of C minor.  Another inversion to D-F-A&flat;-C&flat;/(B) gets you 
  to the vii7 of E&flat; minor, while one last inversion to F-A&flat;-C&flat;-E&flat;&flat;(D) brings 
  you to the vii7 of G&flat; minor (or F&sharp; minor).  This makes the vii7 chord very 
  useful for modulating to different keys, related by relative minors.  Thus, 
  the G&sharp; dim7 can resolve to A minor, C minor, E&flat; minor, or G&flat;/F&sharp; minor.  
  There are in fact only three different dim7 chords:  G&sharp;-B-D-F, A-C-E&flat;-G&flat;, 
  and B&flat;-D&flat;-E-G.  Note that none of these dim7 chords have any tones in 
  common.  Each one of them can resolve to four different keys, moving a half 
  step up from any given note in the chord.  Its a very useful chord, and 
  somehow doesn't sound quite as dissonant as the augmented or half-diminished 
  chords (IMHO).
