  <h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Theory on Tap<br>
  Major Scale Part II</h2>
  <div align=center>by: <strong>Will Pirkle</strong>, <small><i>Et al.</i></small><p></div>

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  In <a HREF="tot.3.html">Part I</a> of this lesson, I gave a brief rundown of 
  the history of Western Music and how the Major Scale plays an important role.
  We saw that there are some neat things that happen when you arrange the 12
  chromatic notes into a 7-note scale consisting of mixed whole and half steps.
  There is an interesting phenomena that occurs with the 4th and 5th tones.
  Lesson I was written to give people a reason to <em>want</em> to learn the 
  major scale (unlike most music teachers who force you to blindly learn 
  scales "because everyone else does").

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  In Part II, I'm going to show the Major Scale Recipe, and how the scale 
  arranges itself on the Stick(TM) fretboard.  Hopefully, this will provide an 
  ample foundation for the future Theory On Tap teachers to use.  Perhaps, they 
  will incorporate some of the Major Scale INsights I'm trying to provide here so 
  that a unifying thread will tie the lessons together.

  <h2>The Recipe</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  In the last lesson, we observed that learning note-sequences
  consisting of only half steps or only whole steps has a limited
  useage in Western Music.  We want to learn the note sequences
  that are ripe with harmonically interesting ideas -- perhaps even
  so that we may purposely violate the ideas (atonal and 20th Century
  Music).  The Major Scale is a mixture of half and whole steps
  that "work" in a secure way with the root, 4th and 5th of the key
  you are in.  You can make any major scale by taking the following
  recipe and applying it to the chromatic sequence of notes:

  <p>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>G</td><td>G#</td><td>A</td><td>A#</td><td>B</td><td>C</td>
    <td>C#</td><td>D</td><td>D#</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>F#</td>
    <td>G</td><td>G#</td><td>A</td><td>A#</td><td>B</td><td>C</td>
    <td>C#</td><td>D</td><td>D#</td><td>E</td><td>....</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <strong>or</strong><br>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>G</td><td>Ab</td><td>A</td><td>Bb</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>Db</td>
    <td>D</td><td>Eb</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>Gb</td><td>G</td><td>Ab</td>
    <td>A</td><td>Bb</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>Db</td><td>D</td><td>Eb</td>
    <td>E</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
  </table>


  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  These sequences of notes are identical in pitch, but not name
  (notice that C# = Db, etc...). The resaons for naming with #'s
  or b's will become obvious in later lessons, especially the Circle
  of 4ths lesson.
  <p>
  The Major Scale Recipe is:<br>

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td>W W h W W W h</td><td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Where:</td><td>W = Whole Step</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><br></td> <td>h = half step</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  If you have a piano nearby, you'll see that this WWhWWWh is the precise 
  arrangement of the white keys starting with C.  Thus, it is the C Major scale 
  on the piano.
  <p>


  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Suppose you want to produce the series of notes in the A Major
  Scale.  What you do is start on A in the chromatic sequence above,
  and follow the recipe.  Remember that the above sequence extends
  in both directions forever.  
  <p>
  The process goes as follows:
  <p>
  <table>
  <caption> A-Major Scale <br> <small>(Key of A Major)</small> </caption>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting note:</td> <td><br></td> <td>A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whole Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whole Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>C#</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>half Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td>  <td>D</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whole Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whole Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>F#</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whole Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td> <td>G#</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>half Step</td> <td>&rarr;</td>  <td>A</td>
  </tr>
  </table> 

  <p>
  Resulting in the sequence: A B C# D E F# G# A

  <p>
  <strong>Exercise:</strong> Derive the Major Scale for the following keys: <br>
  C Major, G Major, F# Major

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  You should be able to apply the Recipe and come out with the
  correct sequences (answers at the end of this lesson).  

  <p>

  There is an easier way to learn the note names to all 12 of the
  Major Scales by learning about <em>Key Signatures</em> and <em>The
  Cycle of 4ths/5ths</em> -- these topics are handled
  in later Theory On Tap lessons.  It is important to know the
  names of the notes within the scales, even if you are learning
  the Major Scale by pattern recognition instead of note names.  In
  <a href="tot.3.html">Part I</a>, I discussed the concept of tonal
  music and movement from one tonal area (key) to other areas.
  Knowing the names of the notes, and their <em>degree</em> gives
  you a lot of options for tonal movement.  Degree really means
  interval: in the above example of A Major, we say that B is the
  2nd degree, and G# is the 7th degree, etc... For completeness,
  here are the degrees of the Major Scale (with the example being
  the Key of A Major):

  <p>
  <table>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <th>Note Name</th>  <th>Degree</th>  <th>Musical Terminology</th>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>A</td>  <td>1st</td>  <td>tonic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>B</td>  <td>2nd</td>  <td>supertonic</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>C#</td>  <td>3rd</td>  <td>mediant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>D</td>  <td>4th</td>  <td>subdominant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>E</td>  <td>5th</td>  <td>dominant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>F#</td>  <td>6th</td>  <td>submediant</td>
  </tr>
  <tr ALIGN=CENTER>
    <td>G#</td>  <td>7th</td>  <td>leading-tone</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>The Major Scale on the Stick</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  There is a diagram in Emmett Chapman's book, <cite>Free Hands</cite>, called
  STRINGS IN 4THS TO INFINITY.  I am going to touch a little on this diagram, 
  but I think that <cite>Free Hands</cite> does an impressive job of describing,
  discussing, and relating this pattern to to the Stick TouchBoard(TM). Also, I
  think the point of Theory On Tap is to add some Music Theory that can be used
  to support and supplement <cite>Free Hands</cite>, and not to simply repeat 
  or replace what's already there.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8> The Major Scale has
  an interesting relationship with the 4th and 5th scale degrees.
  An instrument tuned purely in 4ths or 5ths (inverted 4ths) is
  bound to have an equally interesting relationship to the Major
  Scale.  The one-octave Major scale has the following patterns on
  the Melody side of the Stick:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' href='images/One_octave_major_scale_pattern_1.svg' >
      <img src='images/One_octave_major_scale_pattern_1.svg'></img>
  </a>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Check out for yourselves the location of the WWhWWWh pattern.  Do
  it!  Prove it to youself.  It will also be helpful to remember
  the degree numbers with relationship to the root in terms of
  graphic position. Here is another way to play the same notes:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' href='images/One_octave_major_scale_pattern_2.svg' >
      <img src='images/One_octave_major_scale_pattern_2.svg'></img>
  </a>
  <p>
  This pattern produces the same pitches and the same sequence of
  WWhWWWh.  Here is a third way:

  <p>
  <a target='popup' href='images/One_octave_major_scale_pattern_3.svg' >
      <img src='images/One_octave_major_scale_pattern_3.svg'></img>
  </a>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Hold on!!  These 3 patterns produce the same pitches, same WWhWWWh sequence,  
  but look totally different.  You are discovering something called an 
  over-abundance of options that happens on any stringed instrument (except 
  keyboard operated, and harp-like ones).  The same notes occur many times on 
  different strings in different positions.  

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  What Emmett did with the Infinite 4ths diagram was to tame this over-abundance 
  and put it in a perspective that almost anyone can easily grasp! 

<p>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br></td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  To really know the major scale, you need to be able to play it anywhere on the 
  Stick, starting from any note.   The Infinite 4ths diagram shows that the Major 
  Scale pattern really repeats itself every 7 strings.  If you learn this one 
  pattern, you can play the Major Scale anywhere on the neck, starting from any 
  note.  Sounds like a miracle.  Maybe it is.

  Remember, 7 notes in the Major Scale, 3+2+2 = 7, the 5th is 7 half steps from 
  the root, pattern repeats every 7 strings; there is even more numerology than

  Because the Melody half is tuned in pure 4ths, this pattern wraps around the 
  fretboard spirally (see reference at end for more details).  So, unless you 
  have a 10 string all melody Stick, you won't be able to see the whole pattern 
  in a given position; only part of it.

  Since the bass strings are tuned in inverted 4ths (5ths, that is), you would

  7 strings.  And, it contains the Infinte 4ths diagram within it!

  Learning to play and move these patterns all over the neck is a matter of 
  learning which <em>part</em> of the pattern you are in relative to your tonic or root 
  note.  This means learning the scale starting from (and ending on) any of the 
  above notes.  As it turns out,  scales based off of different notes of a 
  particular scale are called <em>modes</em>  All of the Major Scale's modes are 
  contained in the Infinite 4ths diagram, it just depends on where you start and 
  end the portion of the pattern.  The next Thoery On Tap lesson is going to 
  discuss the modes in a LOT more detail, but I'd like to give one pointer on the 
  modes:

  It is easy to fall into the trap of associating the modes with the Major Scale 
  they are derived from.  In other words, thinking of the modes as a subset.  
  This is natural since their patterns fall out of the Major Scale pattern.  If 
  you do this, your compositions will wind up sounding Major all the time (no 
  variety).  It is OK to conceive and learn the modes as they relate to the Major 
  Scale they come from.  Once you have done this, begin looking at the modes as 
  <em>altered</em> major scales.  Break them away from their associated "parent" 
  Major Scale and <em>listen</em>

  In the Modes lesson, you are going to find out how to play certain modes over 
  certain chords.  This is the really musical way to use the modes.  When you 
  have learned the patterns, go back and listen to the modes very closely, 
  independent of any root chord.  The modes each have a different flavor, a 
  different mood that is associated with them.  In the Modes lesson you'll learn 
  how to capitalize on the moods they create by backing them up with the 
  appropriate chords (or, backing up chords with the appropriate modes -- either 
  way produces the same result).

  I started this off with the concept that melodies come from note sequences (and 
  rhythms).  We want to learn robust, generalized note sequences to use for 
  composition and improvisation.  There is a special relationship between the 
  Major Scale and the 4th and 5th tones.  The number 7 comes up a lot.  In 
  addition, the derivitave scales, called the modes, give us even more note 
  sequences that fit nicely over an almost infinite variety of chord structures 
  which form the backbone of our compositions.

  It will take more Theory On Tap to tie this together with chords, key changes, 
  different tonal centers and songwriting/improvisation.  Consume and digest the 
  Infinite 4ths Pattern and Infinite 5ths pattern.  Then, stay tuned for more 
  Theory On Tap and always experiment on your instrument.  The Stick is designed 
  to be musically friendly.  Make it talk!
