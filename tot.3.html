  Lesson 3: Major Scales and other Phenomena</h2>
  <h3 ALIGN=CENTER>aka: The History of Our Musical World, Part I</h3>

  My job in this article is to explain the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale'>Major Scale</a> and why we
  need to know it and why the Stick(TM) FreeHands method is such a
  good medium for it.  When I started on this journey, I realized
  that there are two paths to take: 

  <ol>
   <li>Say "the Major Scale exists, here is its pattern on the Stick, and enjoy 
      practicing it" (yeah, right).  
   <li> Explain <strong>why</strong> you will want to spend many hours 
      practicing it.  Give the necessary patterns, and encourage raw 
      experimentation.
  </ol>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  In choosing path (2), I then realized that you can't explain 
  <strong>why</strong> unless you 
  explain a whole lot more, like where music came from.  I try not to push my 
  philosophy of music, but rather give a brief (ha!) run down of some of the 
  essentials, like melody and keys and stuff. So here goes: get a snack and a 
  refreshment -- you are in for a long ride.

  <p>
  <h2>Communication</h2>

  <p>`
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Humans probably first made organized noise with their mouths, millions of 
  years ago.  They probably also banged sticks (no pun intended) on rocks to 
  create percussive sounds.  At some point, using either the sticks-on-rocks or 
  the vocalized noise or a combination, they communicated thoughts and ideas.  
  This communication was "aural" communication, not "visual" communication 
  (like drawing pictures in the sand with your fingertip).  Today, we have
  lots of ways of communicating our thoughts and ideas. But, we are all 
  drawn into this forum because of our interest in conveying thoughts and
  ideas through <strong>music</strong>.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Music, in its simplest form, uses rhythm and melody to convey thoughts and 
  ideas.  The rhythm part is rooted in the natural rhythms we observe in 
  everyday life; our heartbeats,  the hoot of an owl, the sound of a waterfall, 
  the rising and setting of the sun and moon.  Melodies have their origin in 
  vocal words.  Observe two people having a conversation.  Be attentive and 
  listen to the pitch (highness or lowness) in the voices as if they are 
  actually singing in some strange form.  For most, the speaking voice is not 
  mono-tonic but instead, it moves around.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  As you ask a question, the pitch of your voice will rise near the end of the 
  phrase.  And, as you answer a question in an affirmative manner, your pitch 
  will drop near the end of that phrase.  In speech we convey thoughts NOT ONLY 
  with the actual words  (literal meanings), BUT ALSO with the rhythm and pitch 
  of our voices (inflection and emphasis).  I can remember my mother saying 
  "Don't speak to me in that tone of voice!" -- she was teaching me how a 
  particular pitch/rhythm pattern conveys unpleasant ideas.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Part of the key to understanding music and the concept of melody is to 
  understand how the non-literal part of speech contains and conveys 
  information.  As an instrumental musician, your job is conveying feelings and 
  thoughts without words.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  So how do you convey a thought with a melody?  Generally, you need to create 
  <em>phrases</em> which are distinctive combinations of single or multiple 
  note-sequences, and then group the phrases together in a way that makes 
  musical sense.   Phrasing is not an easy thing to practice or teach.  Often, 
  phrasing is what separates the great musicians from the good ones.(1), (2)  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Many types of music, most notably blues, jazz and classical, use a 
  call-and-response mechanism in which one phrase is played, then a 
  complementary  phrase follows, like a Drill Sergeant calling out cadences as 
  the troops march in line (Sound off --1,2 Sound off--3,4...).  Often, the 
  first (questioning) phrase will have a rising pitch shape near the end.  And 
  the response (answering) phrase will have a descending pitch shape near its 
  end.  Just like our voices during conversation.  Do you see the sublime 
  connection between music phrases and spoken phrases?  

  <p>
  <h2>Early Music</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The first interval humans probably discovered was the octave.  Nearly anyone 
  can identify an octave by ear.  There is a "sameness" in the pitch of the two 
  notes, even though the pitch frequencies are different. 

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  At some point, people divided the space between the octave into discrete
  units (notes).  How many notes?  Without getting into a bunch of mumbo-jumbo,
  us Westerners divided the octave into 12 discrete units.  Just to be 
  confusing, we call them <em>half steps</em>.  And we form almost all 
  of our musical thoughts using combinations of just those 12 units.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Since melodies are made of note-sequences (phrases) and rhythms, and since we 
  often use repetition to help our listeners understand our thoughts, then we 
  wind up playing the same note-sequences (or similar note-sequences) very 
  often during a composition.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  When we learn and practice <em>scales</em>, we are learning 
  generalized note-sequences. We learn them so that we may quickly draw 
  upon them at any time and use fragments for phrases, melodies or lead 
  lines. So, we want to learn the note-sequences that are rich with 
  potential for conveying feelings. We want to learn the scales we can 
  get the most mileage out of.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The word <em>scale</em> comes from the Italian <em>scala</em>
  meaning ladder or staircase. A scale is defined as "a series of single
  notes, progressing up or down"(3). So, there are really an infinite 
  number of scales.  Today, we have added another concept to the 
  definition of <em>scale</em> which is that we define a scale 
  within the limits of an octave interval. So, you start on one note, 
  play the notes in the scale ascending or descending, and stop when you
  hit the note an octave above or below your starting one.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The minimum number of notes in a scale is 2, the maximum is 12 (again,
  we are assuming that you will repeat the scale pattern of notes as you
  continue the scale up or down in other octaves). The chromatic scale 
  is the progression of all 12 notes.  You can start the chromatic scale
  on any note. 

  <p>
  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale">
  Chromatic Scale </a>
  starting on C would look like this:
  <br>
  <tt><b>
  C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C
  </b></tt>

  <p>
  The 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-tone_scale">
  Whole-Tone scale 
  </a>
  uses whole-steps between every note and starting on C 
  would look like this:<br>
  <tt><b>
  C D E F# G# A# C
  </b></tt>


  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Spend a few minutes and learn the chromatic scale and the Whole Tone scale.  
  Here are the patterns on the Melody side of the Stick:

  <h4>Chromatic Scale</h4>
  <p>
  <a target='popup' href='images/Chromatic_scale.svg' >
    <img src='images/Chromatic_scale.svg'></img>
  </a>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  HINT: Remember that the Stick Melody strings are tuned in P4's.  This is 5 
  half-steps (see <a href="tot.1.html">Theory On Tap; Lesson I</a>).
  We are playing 4 half steps per 
  string so we have to shift back by 1 fret each time we change up to the next 
  string to make up for not playing all 5 half steps before shifting.
</tr>

  <h4>Whole Tone Scale</h4>
  <p>
  <a target='popup' href='images/Whole_tone_scale.svg' >
    <img src='images/Whole_tone_scale.svg'></img>
  </a>


  <p>
  HINT: Here, we are playing a continual succession of whole steps, 3 whole 
  steps per string.  3 whole steps = 6 half steps and there are only 5 half 
  steps between any pair of strings.  So, you have to shift UP to get the extra 
  half step you need. (If this is not clear, email me privately and I'll fix ya 
  up).

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Play around with these scales for a while and try to build melodies by using 
  fragments of both of them.  Just use the right hand (melody strings only) for 
  now.

  <h2>A Key</h2>
  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  A <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)'><em>Key</em></a> 
  is a tonal center about which a composition, or part of
  a composition, revolves.  A tonal center is established by repeating or
  sustaining the same note -- usually this is done in the bass.  You also
  establish a key by repeatedly coming back to that "home" note over and
  over throughout the course of a composition. 

  <p>
  The way Western, or tonal, music works is this:
  <br>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, establish a key
    <li>Then lead the listener away from the key 
        by moving to related keys (more about that later).  
    <li>Then, you return 
        back to the home key. This "homecoming" is supposed to be satisfying 
        in a musical way.  A good pop tune with a good hook will do that to 
        you; you feel really satisfied when the chorus kicks in.  
  </ul>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8> Nearly all music that
  you hear today uses this principle of establishing a tonal center,
  moving away from that center, then returning. In atonal music,
  you purposely do <i>not</i> do that.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Now, establish a key by playing and sustaining a note in the bass, 
  lets say C. So, here you are playing and sustaining low C's on your
  Stick, and you want to weave a melody over that C by using pieces 
  of the Chromatic or Whole Tone scale. Try that for a while.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  What you might find is that it is kind of difficult to create melodies that 
  hook into that low C when using sequences of just half steps or just whole 
  steps.  The Whole Tone scale should give a "dreamy" kind feeling but not a 
  secure, locked-in sound.  The Chromatic scale will probably give you no real 
  tonal center at all!  (If you didn't actually do this exercise, go back and
  do it; it is worth the 5 minutes)

  <h2>Finally, the Major Scale!</h2>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  There are a lot of different reasons why the Major Scale came to
  be. Some focus on Pythagorus and the simple harmonic motion of
  the planets.  Others focus on the overtone series (don't want to
  get into that now).  John Duarte, in a Guitar Player article,
  says that the major scale evolved.  
  People first found the octave and 5th intervals.  Then added the
  M2nd and M6th (one whole step away from the others). Then added
  the M3rd. That is the <em>Major Pentatonic Scale</em> -- the
  backbone of the Major Scale. Later, the 4th and 7th were added.
  The scientific way that the notes of the Major Scale are related
  probably wasn't on the minds of the masses of people that carved
  out music. They probably just thought it sounded good.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The Major Scale is rich with melodic ideas.  It is a mutant combination 
  of whole steps and half steps.  It possesses a lot of neat mathematical 
  traits too.  It uses 7 of the 12 units we talked about. If I get enough
  requests, I will write a Theory on Tap 3A explaining some of the cool 
  mathematical things that the Major Scale does and maybe even how that
  relates to the reality around us. But, let's talk about some of the 
  neat <strong>musical</strong> things it does.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The root, 5th, and octave are the foundation of many different culture's 
  musical repetoire.  This isn't surprising because the 5th is almost exactly 
  halfway between the root and octave on the frequency scale.  Check out the 
  section called "Inversion" in <a href="tot.1.html">Theory On Tap,
  Lesson I</a>: the 5th and the 4th are reciprocals. Going up a 5th is the
  same as going down a 4th.  The 5th and 4th are related like opposite 
  sides of the same coin.  And, they are both harmonically pleasing 
  (play P4 and P5 intervals and compare the sound with m2 or M7 intervals).

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The Root, 4th and 5th are used to create tonal centers (keys) in just 
  about all "pop" forms of music, from the 1400's to today.  To recap: 
  the 5th is important because it is nearly exactly halfway between the 
  root and octave on the frequency scale.  The 4th is important because it is 
  the reciprocal (or inversion) of the 5th.  There are even psycho-acoustic 
  reasons for these importances.

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  As it turns out, the Major Scale has a real special relationship to the 4th 
  and 5th.  The Major Scale contains a series of whole and half steps arranged 
  in such a way that the Major Scales built off of the 4th and 5th notes 
  of a "source" Major Scale
  <i><b>contain the same notes as the original source scale except for one</b></i>. 

  <p>
  Here is an example: 
  <br>
  <i><small>(Don't worry about how to construct the Major Scale -- that 
  is yet to come. For now, look at the note similarities):</small>
  </i>

  <p>
  <strong>Example: Key of C Major</strong>
  <pre>
  C = Root = Tonic
  F = 4th
  G = 5th</pre>

  <p>

     <td><em>F Major Scale; off the 4th of C</em></td>
  </table>

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Remember how I said that in Tonal music the idea is to establish a key
  center, lead the listener away from the key center by moving to related
  keys, then have a big homecoming back to the original key canter?  As you
  can see here, the "related" tones (4th and 5th) Major Scales only differ
  from the <em>Tonic</em> (home key) by <strong><i>one note!</i></strong>
  That creates a nice palette of musical tones to work with, and three
  separate tonal centers to play in that only differ by 2 notes (the F# 
  and the Bb).  Think about the standard blues progression (1-4-1-5-4-1) 
  -- see all the 5's and 4's?  That isn't just by accident.  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  This 4th/5th relationship holds true for any Major Scale and <strong><i>All
  of its modes </i></strong>
  too!  (Modes come later).  In fact, of all the possible combinations of 7 of 
  the original 12 units (ie all 7-note scales), the Major Scale is the 
  <strong>ONLY</strong> one to behave this way. (4)  

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  Since it is made of a combination of whole <big>and</big> half steps, you aren't limited 
  to the types of melodies you constructed in the previous example (by using 
  only half <big>or</big> whole steps).

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  And, with this neat interaction between the Root, 4th and 5th, you'd expect
  an instrument tuned in 4ths or 5ths or <i>both</i> like the Stick, to have
  interesting arrangements of Major Scale notes on its strings. It does. 

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  This is the crux of the next lesson -- Why the
  Major Scale and Stick are so uniquely related.  For now, chew on
  this and play with some of those exercises. And listen to music
  thinking about the 4th, 5th and common notes.
