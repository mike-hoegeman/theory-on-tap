  Lesson 6, Jazz Progressions: Your Friend, the Two-Five
  </h1>

  by: <strong>Jeff Jetton</strong>
  <p>

  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The goal of this lesson is to show some common chord changes found in
  standard jazz, and to explain why they work the way they do. We'll examine
  some progressions and point out a few key concepts along the way. At first, I
  thought this was going to be an unbelievably huge subject, but the previous
  lessons have laid a great foundation for what follows. Thanks guys!

  Unlike the previous lessons, I'll be notating the chords slightly
  differently. A minor chord will be indicated by a minus sign, like this:
   A-7. This is how you'd find it in many fake books, including the "Real
  Book", and on most handwritten jazz charts you'll come across. It can take a
  bit of getting used to.

  Start by examining the following changes (each slash is one beat):

  The first thing you might notice is that we seem to be in the key of C, and
  all the chords are diatonic to that key. (Diatonic is a fancy way of saying
  that the chords are made up solely from notes in that key.) We can analyze
  this tune by writing some roman numerals on top:
  </td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td width=20><br>  </td>
  <td width=480>
<pre>
  I         VI        II        V7        I
  Cmaj7     A-7       D-7       G7        Cmaj7

<tr>
  <td width=20><br>  </td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We learned in lessons 3 and 4 that all the diatonic chords can be numbered,
  based on their relation to the root of the scale. Or, to put it another way,
  based on the mode they're derived from. Even if this progression were put in
  another key, the numbers would be the same:
  </td>

  </td>
</tr>
</table>

<table border=0 width=500>
<tr>
  <td width=60><br>  </td>
  <td width=440>
  <br>
  [Side Note: Why did I put a "7" after the V, and not after the I, IV, or II?
  Simply to emphasize its dominant nature. It's really no big deal. Don't get
  hung up on it.]

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The second thing you might notice (especially if you tried this out on your
  Stick) is that after we jump to the VI chord, the root travels down a perfect
  fifth consistently. For many reasons, our ears gravitate toward that
  "resolution" of a chord down a fifth. And the more dissonant a chord is, the
  more we tend to want it to resolve.

  Check out the interval between the third and the seventh of a dominant
  seventh chord, like the G7 in our example:
  <p>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br>  </td>
  <td width=480>
<pre>
  seventh  F ------|
  fifth    D       |----- B and F are a tritone apart
  third    B ------|
  root     G

  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td width=20><br>  </td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  You could call it an augmented fourth, or a diminished fifth. Most folks call
  it a "tritone", since it's basically three whole steps. It's one of the more
  dissonant intervals there is, and it only appears once in a major
  scale--between the fourth and seventh degrees. The strong resolution of the
  dominant V7 chord to the tonic I chord is known, oddly enough, as "dominant
  resolution".

  [Side Note: In classical music, an instance of dominant resolution is called
  an "authentic cadence". Either term sounds impressive at cocktail parties.]

  <h2>TWO-FIVES</h2>

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The whole "down a fifth" thing, coupled with the strong sound of a dominant
  resolution, has made the II/V/I progression a very popular one in jazz. When
  I say "popular" here, I mean it in the same sense as "breathing is very
  popular among animals with lungs". "Two-fives", as they're often called, are
  on nearly every page of any book of jazz standards.

  <td width=20><br>  </td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  A II/V strongly suggests its "parent" key. When you come across a minor 7
  chord that moves down a fifth to a dominant chord, it may not always be a
  II/V in the key of the song, but it does put the song in a "key of the
  moment". You could also call this key of the moment a "key center", and
  that's exactly what we did in lesson 4. Look at these changes, which bear a
  remarkable resemblance to the chords in "Misty" (if Misty where in the key of
  C):

  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We're in the key of C, so the diatonic chords are easy to pick out--Cmaj7 and
  Fmaj7 are made up of notes from the C major scale. But what about the chords
  that go outside the key?:
  </td>

  <td width=20><br>  </td>
  <td width=480>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We call that part in the middle a "two-five into the four chord". How's that
  for jargon? All it really means is that, instead of just going the the IV (in
  this case, Fmaj7), we toss in a "relative" two-five along the way. The
  two-five is diatonic to the key of F, not C. It makes you feel like the F is
  the tonic chord for a short while, or that we've suddenly switched to a C
  Mixolydian mode. (Remember modes? Sure you do!) Although the song is in C, F
  is the key of the moment during those last two bars, and the relative
  two-five is what leads you there.

  As luck would have it, you can use this information when playing a melody or
  soloing over those changes. An F major scale (F Ionian) or C Mixolydian (same
  thing, note-wise) sounds great over those chords. In fact, the melody for
  "Misty" hits a B-flat during that part, which makes sense, since that note is
  in the key of F, not C.

  <h2>THREE-NOTE VOICINGS</h2>

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  It's time to put this mumbo-jumbo to some specific, real use. So put down
  your Mupp-o-phones and Bulgarian Zithers, plug in your Stick, and read on...

  Brace yourself for Universal Truth #978: "Apart from the root note, the most
  important notes in a seventh chord are the third and the seventh." This is
  because the third tells us whether the chord is major or minor, and the
  seventh tells us whether the chord is dominant or not. What does the fifth
  do? Not much, besides just sitting there being perfect. For several reasons,
  which we won't get into here, it's common to omit the fifth entirely. Here,
  we're going to omit it for purely instructional reasons, since it leaves us
  with a nice, three-note voicing that allows us to concentrate on the third
  and seventh:

  Sounds nice, eh? In real life, you'd probably play the alternate root an
  octave lower, but for now, play the one marked with an "X". Let's continue

  What chord did you just play? You've turned the major 7 chord into a minor 7
  chord. In fact, you could consider the new chord to be the II-7 chord in a
  new key. That new key is one whole step (two frets) lower than the first key.

  As luck would have it, that's part of your exercise for this lesson, start
  high on the neck and play the II/V/I progression. When you get to the Imaj7,
  turn it a II-7 and start all over. You'll wind up "two-fiving" your way down
  the neck, changing keys each time. Try it with both the original and
  alternate roots for the II-7.

  You'll find that the same rules apply: the seventh always move down one fret,
  becoming the third, and you can always move both notes down at the end to
  make your new II-7.
