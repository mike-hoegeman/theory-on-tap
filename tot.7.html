  While many people think of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale'>pentatonic scales</a> as nothing
  more than a trick to use when playing the blues, I think
  you'll find these simple five tone scales have a broad range
  of feelings and styles.


  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  The prefix `Penta' means five.  So a pentatonic scale
  is a five tone scale.  When we think of pentatonics most
  people think of the blues scale, but you can build a
  pentatonic scale out of ANY five scale tone you want.
  Mathematically this is shown as "12 choose 5".   Which is:

  <p>
  <pre>
        12!
  -------------  =  792
  5! ( 12 - 5)!
  </pre>

  <p>
  Which gives us 792 pentatonic scales and each of them can be
  played in any key so there are actually 9504 scales ,
  although not all of them sound good.  So the next time
  someone tells you pentatonics are too limited, slap them.
  (Or better yet, ask them to name them all).

  <p>
  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  We're going to concentrate on just a few of these scales.  Probably
  the most popular pentatonic scale is the <a
  href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_scale'>blues scale</a>.
  Before I show you this scale we must learn to play the blues.
  <i>The 12 Bar Blues</i> chord changes are based on a I-IV-V chord
  sequence.   Notice how the entire chord sequence uses only these
  three chords:


<p>
<br>
<pre>
   C              F              C              C
<b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>

   F              F              C              C
<b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>

   G              F              C              C
<b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>  /  /  /  /  <b>|</b>
</pre>

<p>
  In the key of C, the `I' scale tone is C, the `IV' scale
  tone is F, and the `V' scale tone is G.

  You'll notice that I'm refering to scale tones rather
  than the I chord, the V chord or the IV chord.  If you
  remember from my mode lesson, the I and IV should be major
  7th chords, and the V is a dominant 7th chord.  But if you
  play it this way it sounds like . . . . well . . . .It
  certainly isn't the blues.   We usually just play dominant
  7th chords for each (or anything based on a 7th, like a 9th,
  11th or 13th chord).

  OK, what about the blues scale?  The blues pentatonic
  uses the following notes of the I scale:   Root, m3, 4, 5,
  b7.   Wait a minute!  We're playing a 7th chord which has a
  Major 3rd in it and our scale has a minor 3rd!  How can this
  sound good?  Well, that's what gives it the bluesy sound
  we're so use to.  On the Stick this scale looks like this:

  Of course, this is just one way to play it.  You can invert
  some of the notes and get this fingering:

  Usually, the fingering is just the first and third fingers
  which allows us to move really fast.  We can also use a
  bending technique to give it a bluesier feeling.  Any of the
  notes can be bent but traditionally we bend like this:

  I should mention that a blues player generally stays in the
  same scale regardless of where they are in the chord
  progression.  So if we're playing in the key of C we find
  the C blues scale and set up house for the whole song.
  After a while this could get a bit tedious so we need some
  tricks to open up our sound.

  You might have noticed how easily the dorian scale fits on
  top of this pentatonic scale.  This is a good way to `jazz
  up' your solo and break out of the old blues cliches.

  Another good trick is to switch between a mixolydian and the
  blues pentatonic.  You can play the mixolydian mode of
  whatever chord you're on, and then switch to the blues
  pentatonic in whatever key you're in.  Remember, you're
  moving the mixolydian, but not the pentatonic.  It's no
  wonder the blues pentatonic scale is so popular.  You just
  find your home position and jam until they turn out the
  lights and lock the doors.

  Of course, you can follow the chord structure with your
  pentatonic as well.  Just follow the I-IV-V movement of the
  blues progression with the root tone of the scale.  There's
  a lot of ground to cover with that little 5 note scale.

  There is an excelent source for music theory called
  by Mark Levine called
  <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Theory-Book-Mark-Levine/dp/1883217040/'>
  "The Jazz Theory Book" 
  </a>
  that discusses pentatonic scales and the blues
  in ch. 9 and 10 of the book in more detail. 

  I'd like to finish the lesson with a few thoughts from an article by Ed
  Price on alternative pentatonics from that web site :

  <img src="./images/dot_clear.gif" hspace=8>
  <blockquote>
  <p>
  Other five note scales are used occasionally as well. For instance, the
  scale "E, F, A, B, D" is the traditional Japanese 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insen_scale'>Insen scale</a>. 
  It can be used as a substitute for the E phrygian mode (note it
  in fact defines the E phrygian chord) to impart an Asian flavor
  to the music. Useful variations of this scale include the second
  mode, "F, A, B, D, E", which can be used over a Fmaj7#11 chord;
  the fourth mode, "B, D, E, F, A", which can be used over a Bm7b5
  chord; and the fifth mode, "D, E, F, A, B", which can be used
  over a Dm6 chord.

  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  Since there are relatively few notes in a pentatonic scale, one pentatonic
  scale can often be used over several different chords with no real avoid
  notes. For instance, the C major pentatonic scale "C, D, E, G, A" could be
  used over Cmaj7, C7, D7sus, Dm7, Em7b6, Fmaj7, G7sus, Gm7, or Am7.
  </blockquote>

  Thanks Ed.

<p>
As you can see, there's a lot of fun in that simple five note scale.
And you can get a lot of blues, and a lot of sound from a very simple
technique.  Have fun with it!
